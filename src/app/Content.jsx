/**
 * This is the Component that will switch out what Component is being shown
 * depending on the "url" of the page
 * <br>
 * You'll notice that we have a <Routes> Component and inside it, we have
 * multiple <Route> components. Each <Route> maps a specific "url" to show a
 * specific Component.
 * <br>
 * Whenever you add a Route here make sure to add a corresponding NavLink in
 * the NavBar Component.
 * <br>
 * You can essentially think of this as a switch statement:
 * @example
 * switch (url) {
 *     case "/login":
 *         return <Login/>;
 *     case "/":
 *         return <Home/>;
 * }
