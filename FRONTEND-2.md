# Video Submission

## Create a video submission. 
YouTube private video, shared by link, works well for video submission for this class. Video submissions should be less than 2 minutes long and follow this scenario:
1. Off-screen, deploy your IDM Service, your Movies service, and your mini-frontend on your local device. Do not include this part in the video.
2. Open your browser and open a network panel (`CTRL + SHIFT + J` on Windows, or `COMMAND + OPTION + J` on Mac). Keep this panel open as you continue with the following steps.
3. Navigate to your website. (we should see the Login View with a link to Register Page)
4. Navigate to the Register View. Register a new user. (we should see a switch to the Login Page)
5. Login using the user you just created. (we should see a switch to Home Page)
6. Search for movies with `game` in their title. If necessary, scroll to show the results.
7. Search for movies with directors named `Chris`. If necessary, scroll down to show the results.
8. Search for movies released in the year `2005`. If necessary, scroll down to show the results.

## Submit the video
Submit a link to your video on the corresponding Canvas assignment.
