# Video Submission

## Create a video submission. 
YouTube private video, shared by link, works well for video submission for this class. Video submissions should be less than 2 minutes long and follow this scenario:
1. Off-screen, deploy your IDM microservice and mini-frontend on your local device. Do not include this part in the video.
2. Open your browser and open a network panel (`CTRL + SHIFT + J` on Windows, or `COMMAND + OPTION + J` on Mac). Keep this panel open as you continue with the following steps.
3. Try to log in using an unregistered username and password. 
   - They should have a alert with a response with a result.message of `User not found`
5. Next, register a new user (e.g., with login panteater@uci.edu and a password of your choice).
   - They should have a alert with a response with a result.message of `User registered successfully`
6. Log in using the user you just registered (e.g., panteater@uci.edu).
   - They should have a alert with a response with a result.message of `User logged in successfullyy`
 
## Submit the video
Submit a link to your video on the corresponding Canvas assignment.
